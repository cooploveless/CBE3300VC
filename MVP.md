## 1. Post-Packing Column Rinse

After packing the activated carbon column, we recirculated 200 mL of DI water through the system to assess carbon leaching and stabilize baseline conductivity before introducing any zinc-contaminated solution.

*Figure 1: Column pre-rinse procedure.*

**Key findings:**
- Carbon leaching had no significant impact on TDS measurements under normal operating conditions.
- A ~100 mL pre-rinse is sufficient to reach a stable baseline.
- Target pump shut-off: **digital output of 385**

## 2. Purification Runs

We completed three full purification trials using 200 mL of 2000 ppm Zn²⁺ solution. The TDS sensor continuously monitored effluent quality and the Arduino shut off the pump once the digital output reached the target threshold.

*Figure 3: TDS digital output vs. time — Trial 1.*

*Figure 4: TDS digital output vs. time — Trial 2.*

![Trial 3](/CBE3300VC/assets/trial3.png)
*Figure 5: TDS digital output vs. time — Trial 3.*

Each run shows two consistent regimes:

1. **Rapid initial drop (0–2 min):** Fresh adsorption sites on the carbon quickly capture Zn²⁺.
2. **Gradual decline (2–12.5 min):** As the bed approaches saturation, removal slows and TDS decays toward the shut-off threshold.

The adaptive shut-off triggered reliably across all three trials, confirming the system's ability to self-regulate based on real-time water quality.

## 3. Housing

*Figure 6: Arduino and circuit housing.*

A preliminary enclosure was fabricated to house the Arduino, relay, and wiring. Foam padding was added inside to dampen pump vibration and reduce operating noise.

## 4. Next Steps

Our primary focus going forward is refining the housing. This includes improving the fit and finish of the enclosure, better securing all internal components, and adding cutouts for cable management and sensor access.
